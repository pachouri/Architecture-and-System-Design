<h2>API Gateway System Design</h2>
(https://github.com/pachouri/Architecture-and-System-Design/blob/main/diagram/APIGatewaySystemDesing.gif?raw=true)

<b>1. Client Request</b> <br>
Step: Clients (mobile apps, web applications, etc.) send API requests.
Components: Various clients or consumers.
<br><b>2. API Gateway</b> <br>
Step: The API Gateway receives the incoming requests.
Components:
Request Routing: Directs the request to the appropriate backend service.
Authentication & Authorization: Verifies the identity of the client and ensures they have permission to access the requested resources.
Rate Limiting: Controls the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame to prevent abuse.
Request Transformation: Modifies the request format, such as adding headers or altering the payload, if necessary.
Caching: Stores responses to reduce load on backend services and improve response times for repeated requests.
<br><b>3. Backend Services</b> <br>
Step: The API Gateway forwards the request to the appropriate backend service.
Components:
Microservices/Monolithic Services: The actual services that handle business logic and interact with databases or other systems.
Service Discovery: Determines the location of backend services, typically using a service registry.
Load Balancer: Distributes incoming requests across multiple instances of backend services to ensure high availability and reliability.
<br><b>4. Analytics & Monitoring</b> <br>
Step: Track and analyze API usage data.
Components:
Logging: Collects detailed logs of API requests and responses for analysis and troubleshooting.
Metrics Collection: Gathers data such as response times, request counts, and error rates.
Real-time Monitoring: Provides dashboards and alerts for monitoring API performance and health.
Analytics Engine: Processes and analyzes logs and metrics to provide insights into usage patterns, performance, and potential bottlenecks.
Data Storage: Stores analytics data in a time-series database or other storage solutions for long-term analysis.
<br><b>5. Response Handling</b> <br>
Step: Backend services process the request and return a response.
Components:
Response Transformation: The API Gateway may modify the response format if necessary before sending it back to the client.
Error Handling: Ensures that any errors in the request or processing are properly handled and communicated back to the client with appropriate error codes and messages.
<br><b>6. Client Response</b> <br>
Step: The API Gateway sends the final response back to the client.
Components:
Data Delivery: The processed data or error message is sent back to the client.
Analytics Update: The API Gateway updates the analytics and monitoring systems with the response data.
<br><b>7. Security & Compliance</b> <br>
Step: Ensure ongoing security and compliance throughout the API lifecycle.
Components:
Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
Compliance Checks: Regular audits and checks to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
Security Policies: Enforce security policies like SSL/TLS, OAuth, and JWT.
